**Dataset**
The challenge was based on two primary datasets: 'test.csv' and 'train.csv', located in the data folder of this repository. My submission, 'answer.csv', was crafted using the techniques and insights detailed in [MyNotebook](https://github.com/gjftns7220/UAIS-Alberta-Wildfires-Datathon/blob/main/notebook/Alberta_Wildfire_Datathon_Size_Classification.ipynb), which is available for your review.
